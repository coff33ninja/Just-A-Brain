System Design

    Modules: Six Python modules (frontal.py, parietal.py, temporal.py, occipital.py, cerebellum.py, limbic.py), each containing a class for its respective AI. Each AI starts as a tiny neural network or model (~5,000–20,000 parameters, approximated by small arrays or simple architectures) and includes methods for task processing, learning, and bedtime consolidation.
    Main Script: main.py initializes the AIs, routes inputs/outputs, and manages the "daytime" (task processing) and "bedtime" (consolidation) cycles.
    Functionality:
        Each AI processes tasks relevant to its brain region (e.g., occipital for vision, frontal for planning).
        Learning occurs via simple updates (e.g., gradient descent, reinforcement learning) during tasks.
        Bedtime consolidation refines models by replaying experiences and saving updates to disk.
        Purpose emerges from environmental feedback, with no predefined goals.
    Dependencies: We’ll use NumPy for lightweight neural network operations and JSON for persistent storage (mimicking SSD saves). For simplicity, I’ll avoid heavy frameworks like TensorFlow, but you can scale up later.

Implementation

Below, I’ll provide a minimal implementation for each module and main.py, focusing on modularity, simplicity, and the "baby AI" concept. Each AI uses a basic neural network (or equivalent) for processing, a memory buffer for learning, and a consolidation step for bedtime. The system is designed to run on modest hardware (e.g., CPU-based, minimal RAM), with growth simulated by updating weights and memory.

Explanation

    Modules: Each module (frontal.py, etc.) defines a class with:
        A tiny model (NumPy arrays for weights, simulating ~5,000–20,000 parameters).
        process_task: Handles inputs specific to the AI’s role (e.g., vision for occipital).
        learn: Updates weights based on feedback (e.g., RL for frontal, error correction for cerebellum).
        consolidate: Replays experiences at bedtime, refining weights and saving to JSON.
        save_model/load_model: Persists weights to disk, mimicking SSD storage.
    main.py:
        Initializes all AIs and coordinates tasks.
        process_day: Routes inputs (e.g., vision, sensors) to appropriate AIs, collects outputs, and applies feedback for learning.
        bedtime: Triggers consolidation for all AIs.
        Uses random inputs for demonstration; you can replace with real data (e.g., camera feeds, user text).
    Learning and Growth:
        AIs start with random weights, acting like a "baby" with no purpose.
        They learn from feedback during tasks (e.g., rewards, errors) and consolidate nightly, mimicking brain plasticity.
        Purpose emerges as AIs specialize based on frequent tasks (e.g., occipital AI becomes better at vision if fed more images).
    Storage: Models and memories are saved in a data/ folder as JSON files, keeping the system lightweight and persistent.

Running the System

    Create the folder structure and save each file.
    Ensure Python and NumPy are installed (pip install numpy).
    Run main.py: python main.py
    The script simulates 3 days, processing random inputs and consolidating each night. Outputs show actions, motor commands, and emotions, which evolve as AIs learn.

Example Output
text
Day 1
Action: 2, Motor: [0.012, -0.008, 0.005], Emotion: 1
Starting bedtime consolidation...
Consolidation complete.
Day 2
Action: 3, Motor: [0.015, -0.007, 0.006], Emotion: 0
Starting bedtime consolidation...
Consolidation complete.
...
Customization and Next Steps

    Real Inputs: Replace random inputs with actual data (e.g., OpenCV for vision, audio libraries for text, sensor APIs for robotics).
    Scaling Models: Add parameters dynamically (e.g., increase input_size) as AIs grow, using neural architecture search.
    Purpose Emergence: Introduce a reward function based on environmental feedback (e.g., user praise) to guide specialization.
    Visualization: I can generate a diagram of the AI interactions or a flowchart if you confirm you want an image.
    Specific Use Case: If you have a scenario (e.g., robot, chatbot), I can tailor inputs and feedback to simulate it.
    Add more sophisticated learning (e.g., RL algorithms, clustering).
    Visualize the system (confirm for image generation).
    Refine a module or add features (e.g., curiosity-driven exploration).
